A sidecar output widget for JupyterLab

## Installation

You can install the sidecar with conda:
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge sidecar
```

Or with pip:
```bash
pip install sidecar
```

You then need to install the labextension:
```bash
jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-sidecar
```

## Usage

The sidecar widget is used as a context manager, just like ipywidgets' output
widget.

```python
from sidecar import Sidecar
from ipywidgets import IntSlider

sc = Sidecar(title='Sidecar Output')
sl = IntSlider(description='Some slider')
with sc:
    display(sl)
```

When a single output is displayed in a Sidecar, it is allowed to occupy all of
the vertical space available. If more content is displayed, the natural height
is used instead.
